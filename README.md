# Statistical Machine Learning
This folder contains all the exercises from the master's course Machine Learning and Computational Statistics as well as the final project.
It mostly analyzes traditional machine learning algorithms from their statistical perspective by diving deeper into the mathematical 
funtamentals and intuition begind their inception.

The final project is an interesting compination of all those algorithms to solve a computer vision problem using the salinas dataset

# Hand on Data Science
It contains mostly large projects that showcase the whole pipeline of a data science problem from expploratory data analysis to 
machine learning algorithm tuning.
